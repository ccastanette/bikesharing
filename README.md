# Bringing Bikesharing to Des Moines

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to get enough data to talk to investors about opening a bike share business in Des Moines IA. The data we are analysing comes from a similar business that is already successfull in New York NY. 

We are able to create several visualizations that included information on the following:
1. Total count of rides

2. Customer type - subscription or one time use

3. Peak Hours

4. Map of the most popular ending locations
5. Which bikes are used the most and will need the most repairs
6. checkout times per user, also broken out by gender
7. The users trips by hour 

We were also able to create a Tableau Story that allows us to create a presentation that includes whichever visualizations we deem important to marketing our idea:
